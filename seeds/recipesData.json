"name": "Lomo Saltado",
"summary": "A famous Peruvian stir fry dish with beef and vegetables sauteed together",
"ingredients": "-1 pound of beef tri tip, sliced to 1/8 thick slices",
"serves": "5",
"prepTime":"60",
"instructions":"Cut all vegetables according to the sizes and then peel and cut the potatoes and let them soak in cold water before frying them. Mix the vinegar and soy sauce in a cup and put to the side for later use. Get a pot out and wash the cup of rice until the water is clear. Add water until it covers the rice and make sure the water doesn't cover more than half of your thumb from the top of your rice or it will be too mushy. Once it boils, put the temperature down to a lower flame and cover for about 20 minutes to cook. Take a frying pan, a wok would be the best, and fry the meat to a medium rare and then take out of the pan. Add the onions, tomatoes and pepper and cook until they begin to get a little soft and then add the sauce you mixed together earlier, add the meat and spices and cilantro. Cook until the beef is to your liking. Add a portion of rice and potatoes to a plate and place the meat and vegetables over that and enjoy!"
