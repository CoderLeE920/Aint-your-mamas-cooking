## Project 2 Unit 15

### homeWork
- With your team, you’ll conceive and execute a design that solves a real-world problem. In creating your first collaborative full-stack application, you’ll combine a robust back end--with servers, databases, advanced APIs, and user authentication—-to an intuitive front end. You’ll continue to build on the agile development methodologies you’ve used throughout this course, like storing your project code in GitHub, managing your work with a project management tool, and implementing feature and bug fixes using the Git branch workflow and pull requests.
- Instead of using the front end you developed for your first project, you should start from scratch. Doing so will help you reinforce your existing front-end abilities and solidify your understanding of the dynamic between the front end and back end. Also, you’ve likely improved your skills since that first project, so with a stronger foundation now you can build a better application, using all of the additional practice you’ve had in the last several weeks.
